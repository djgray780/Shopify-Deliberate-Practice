# A Collection of Coding Dojo Problems


This repository is a collection of problems that originally come from [https://github.com/emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache) and are selected by the developers at Shopify as a method of deliberate practice.

Each directory contains a problem set that I have attempted both on my own, and then later in a pair programming session with a more experienced developer. Each `first_try.py` file will be my own attempt at the problem, followed by a `second_try.py` file that I tackle independently after the pair sessions. I may make a `collaborate.py` file with my partners solution, just as a reference, but I am undecided. 

The original problems can be found here:
